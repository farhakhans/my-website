# Physical AI Book

This is an accessible, comprehensive, and hands-on educational resource that empowers beginner to intermediate learners to understand and implement Physical AI concepts. The book bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling readers to build real-world systems that interact with the physical world through AI-powered sensing, modeling, and control.

## About Physical AI

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI enables machines to perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. This field encompasses robotics, sensor networks, control systems, and other technologies that bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical reality.

## Features

- **Hands-On Learning Approach**: Every concept is accompanied by practical examples, code implementations, and exercises
- **Progressive Complexity Structure**: Content organized from foundational concepts to advanced applications with clear prerequisites
- **Documentation-First Development**: All code examples thoroughly documented with clear explanations and expected outcomes
- **Multi-Modal Learning Support**: Content accommodates different learning styles through text explanations, visual diagrams, and interactive examples
- **Real-World Application Focus**: Examples reflect genuine problems in robotics, computer vision, sensor fusion, physics simulation, and other Physical AI domains

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Using the GitHub Actions workflow (recommended):
The site is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the main branch.

Manual deployment to GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
