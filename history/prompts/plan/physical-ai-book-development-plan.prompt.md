# Physical AI Book Development Plan

## Original Prompt

Create a comprehensive development plan for building a technical book on Physical AI using Docusaurus. The plan should cover:

Project Planning – objectives, target audience, scope, and learning focus (hands-on).

Environment Setup – prerequisites, folder structure, Node.js/npm setup, and project initialization commands.

Project Structure & Configuration – folder hierarchy, key files (docs/, sidebars.js, docusaurus.config.js), and setup for navigation, theme, and branding.

Content Development – chapter and lesson creation guidelines, learning objectives, content outline, code/experiment sections, formatting rules (MDX, headings, callouts, code blocks).

Testing & Preview – local server usage, navigation, and responsiveness checks.

Deployment – instructions for GitHub Pages or alternative hosting (Netlify, Vercel) including build commands and publish directories.

Maintenance & Expansion – adding new chapters, keeping sidebars and content updated, ensuring consistency of brand voice and hands-on learning philosophy.

The output should be step-by-step, actionable, and beginner-friendly, suitable for guiding the creation and deployment of a full Docusaurus-based book.

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for developing a Physical AI technical book using Docusaurus. The plan includes technical context, constitution compliance checks, research findings, data models, API contracts, quickstart guide, and detailed implementation phases. The plan addresses all requested areas: project planning, environment setup, project structure, content development guidelines, testing procedures, deployment options, and maintenance strategies.

## Key Elements

- 8-10 chapter structure with progressive complexity for Physical AI topics
- Docusaurus-based architecture with MDX content and custom components
- Python-primary technology stack with JavaScript and C++ as secondary
- Hands-on learning approach with executable examples and exercises
- Complete API contract for content management and progress tracking
- Detailed deployment strategies for GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel
- Comprehensive data models for chapters, exercises, and resources
